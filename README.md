## Important Notice

Hey all!

I really appreciate people actually using this package, to all the 27 people/projects that use this, thank you!

However, this package is **not ready.** It ***doesn't work.***
Hopefully, when I have the time working on my project that *does* need this, I'll be able to make this viable for use.

Thank you for your euthasium!
This package will not do anything if installed, so you may keep this package in your dependencies list - your build will not fail.
